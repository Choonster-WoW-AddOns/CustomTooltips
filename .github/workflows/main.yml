  # "release" is a job, you can name it anything you want
  release:
    # we can run our steps on pretty much anything, but the "ubuntu-latest" image is a safe bet
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # specify the environment variables used by the packager, matching the secrets for the project on GitHub
